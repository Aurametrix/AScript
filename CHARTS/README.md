A chart requires three libraries:

The Google JSAPI API

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
    
  
The Google Visualization library
The library for the chart itself.

    google.load('visualization', '1.0', {'packages':['corechart']});


These libraries are loaded using two <script> links in your page code
